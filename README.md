# Google Styled Gauge for React using D3

Based on http://bl.ocks.org/tomerd/1499279

I needed a gauge and the ones available already done on React weren't as complete as this one.

## How to use
Just copy the Gauge.js to your prefered location and use to it as you would usually use a React Component.
